Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. His robotic butler Dwigtâ€¦.

# Secret Registration URL of new Employee chat system

http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY

# I am keeping this draft unpublished, as unpublished drafts cannot be accessed by outsiders. I am not that ignorant, Nick.

# Also, stop looking at my drafts. Jeez!

```

We can see this secret link `http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY` in draft.

Adding `10.10.11.143 chat.office.paper` to `/etc/hosts` we can access the webpage

We create a user called `1f919` and a password `password` with an temporary email:

![WebChat](./assets/WebChat.png)

And Scrolling the chat we find a bot with some private access:

![Bot](./assets/Bot.png)

We found a user called `dwight`

We can't inject commands, we can see the parents folders of `sales`. But after exausting HOURS of searching and finding the file `.env` inside the folder `hubot`:

![BotPassword](./assets/BotPassword.png)

Now we can connect into the ssh protocol with the username `dwight` and password `Queenofblad3s!23`.

## Privilege Escalation

Inside the machine we can scp the `linpeas.sh` script and enumerate

![CVE](./assets/CVE.png)

And we already found a [CVE](https://github.com/Almorabea/Polkit-exploit/blob/main/CVE-2021-3560.py).

We can just execute the python script and we get a root shell :D
